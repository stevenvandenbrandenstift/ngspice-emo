Many more details of ngspice usage under Windows is described
in how-to-use-ngspice091031.txt from the binary distribution.

This directory (visualc) with its files 
vngspice.sln (project starter) and
vngspice.vcproj (project contents)
allows to compile and link ngspice with MS Visual Studio 2008.
The project is probably not compatible with Visual Studio 2005.

CIDER and XSPICE are included, but the code models for XSPICE
(*.cm) are not (yet) made. You may however use the code models
created with MINGW (which in fact are dlls), as e.g. found in 
the ngspice binary distribution.

There is currently no installation procedure provided, you may
however install the executable manually as described in the
installation tree below.

/visualc/include contains a dedicated config.h file. It contains the
preprocessor definitions required to properly compile the code.
strings.h has been necessary during setting up the project.


Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 C++

Goto 
/ng-spice-rework/visualc

Start MS Visual Studio 2008 by double click onto 
vngspice.sln

After MS Visual Studio has opened up, select debug or release version 
by checking 'Erstellen' , 'Konfigurations-Manager' 'Debug' or 'Release'

Start making ngspice (called vngspice.exe) by selecting 'Erstellen' and 
'vngspice neu erstellen'.

Object files will be created and stored in visualc/debug or visualc/release.
The executable will be stored to visualc/debug/bin or visualc/release/bin.

Installation tree (as provided with MINGW make install) and also used by
vngspice:

C:\Spice\
	bin\
		ngspice.exe
		nghelp.exe
		ngmakeidx.exe
		ngnutmeg.exe
		cmpp.exe
	lib\
		spice\
			analog.cm
			digital.cm
			spice2poly.cm
			extradev.cm
			extravt.cm
	share\
		info\
			dir
			ngspice.info
			ngspice.info-1
			..
			ngspice.info-10
		man\
			man1\
				ngmultidec.1
				ngnutmeg.1
				ngsconvert.1
				ngspice.1
		ng-spice-rework\
			helpdir\
				ngspice.idx
				ngspice.txt
			scripts\
				ciderinit
				devaxis
				devload
				setplot
				spectrum
				spinit
		
If spinit is not found in the directory cited above,
vngspice.exe also searches for spinit in its own directory. If you give 
a relative path for the codemodel directories in spinit, you may 
determine your own directory tree.

If you want to generate a console ngspice (without GUI, 
without graphics interface, but usable in batch mode (-b)), 
then you have to do the following before compilation:
select console_debug or console_release from the configuration manager.
ngspice.exe will search for spinit in the directory tree shown above, or, 
if not found, in its own directory.

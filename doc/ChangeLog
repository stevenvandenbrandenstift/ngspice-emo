  *  Fixed missing parenthesis around CLEANFILES and DISTCLEANFILES in
     Makefile.am as reported by David Fang <fang@csl.cornell.edu>
     
  *  Fixed the section in ngspice.texi where the use of @/ in a @url{} was
     giving problems. Actually this whole section on the Windows port is now
     out-of-date, and date link was broken, so I have replaced it with something
     more appropriate. thank you to Stuart Brorson for reporting these problems.

  *  Fixed the problems of the AUTHORS file not being found by adding its
     directory to the search paths for makeinfo and for texi2dvi in Makefile.am

  *  Fixed the warning caused by @strong{Note:} in ngspice.texti - used the 
     @quotation Note style as given in the texinfo user manual section 10.2

  *  Added an @include version.texi in the header of the ngspice.texi file.
     This causes automake to create the necessary files and allow the use of
     @value(VERSION) in the ngspice.texi. The .cvsignore file has been adjusted
     to take account of the generated files.

  *  Used @copying and @insertcopying for the copyright text in ngspice.texi
     and modified the file's structure a little. It now more closely follows the
     simple example given in the texinfo user manual.
     
  *  Fixed some of the 'overfull' error generated by TeX when processing
     ngspice.texi - many more still present.
     
  *  removed non-ASCII characters from ngspice.texi. this needed a work-round
     for the degrees symbol - used @math{^o}

  *  Added ngsspice.pdf as an output file of make dist
